# Slide Puzzle Project
This project is a puzzle game where the user is given a 15 piece puzzle that they must sort from least to greatest beginning from top to bottom. The object of the game is to sort the blocks in least to greatest order. The Game screen contains the puzzle and three options on the side to reset the puzzle in the jumbled format, sort the original one, and lastly, start a new game.

The way to move the slide to the right or left is through a mouse click on the block.
